# This program prints out the dates of the 
# bank holidays that occur in northern Ireland.

# The program is then modified to print the 
# bank holidays (names) that are unique to northern Ireland 
# compared to the rest of the UK (you can choose if you want to use the name or the date of the holiday to decide if it is unique.)
